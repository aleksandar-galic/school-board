# School Board Test

Requirements:
PHP
MySQL

Installation:
-run: composer install
-create a database and run sql file
-make a config file for database (see config.example.php)

Issues:
-I tried to implement Logger as an interface but it faild because bramu/router doesn't allow passing constructor parameters when defining route controller.
-I'm not sure I understood the CSMB school board method.
-Student model could use some refactoring.
